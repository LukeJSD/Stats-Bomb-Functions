## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Read In Event Data, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Progressive Play

A progressive action is one that advances the ball 10 yards closer to goal than than to furthest it has been in the last 6 relevant events in the sequence of play, or when the ball in entered into the 18 yard box. The the common actions that can be considered progressive are passes (pP) and carries (pC).

Fun little observation: Mapi Leon, the Spanish defender responsible for the most progressive passes and over 5 progressive carries per 90 at Euro22, is one of the exiled players from Jorge Vilda's World Cup squad. While the group of players has, she is one of the group refusing to play for the national team while Vilda remains its manager.

## Direct Team Play

Directness of play can be measured by the speed at which a team progresses the ball. The directness of a sequence play (a sequence being connsecutive attacking actions, such as passes, carries, dribbles, shots) is the progressed distance from the first event in the sequence to the last per second (so divided by the duration of the sequence). The intricacy of team also relates to how direct they play, which is simply the number of passes per sequence. Generally less direct teams pass more, opting from to patiently move the ball backwards and side to side.


```{r echo=F, fig.height=4, fig.width=7.5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot.directness.competition(events.wc.22, title = "Directness of Teams at the 2022 World Cup")
```

```{r echo=F, fig.height=4, fig.width=7.5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot.directness.competition(events.wc.18, title = "Directness of Teams at the 2018 World Cup")
```

```{r echo=F, fig.height=4, fig.width=7.5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot.directness.competition(events.wwc.19, title = "Directness of Teams at the 2019 World Cup")

# Passing Networks

Passing networks a fairly intuitive football-data visualization. The points/nodes represent each player on a given team, and the line/path connections between represent passes between two players. Nodes are placed at the average location that a given player passes the ball. Passes are normalized to per 90 minute rate. Connections are made when the first player passes to the second at least five times per 90. The number of passes per 90 scales the sizes of the nodes and lines. The network only represents the passes made by the first eleven, and it stops when the first sub is made for the team.

### 2022 World Cup Final

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
final.22.id <- max(wc.22.matches$match_id)
tms <- unique(events.wc.22 %>% filter(match_id==final.22.id))$team.id
plot.passingNetwork(events.wc.22,final.22.id,tms[1])
```

The passing networks above can tell the story of a match (at least part of it) and the roles of certain players. First looking at Argentina's network, nearly every players has at least three line connected to them; this shows that the team was strongly connected by passing and passing well. Additionally we can see that on a simple level, Argentina setup in a 4-3-3 with the fullbacks pushing up slightly further and Mac Allister playing more advanced than his midfield partners. More interestingly, there is an obvious difference in how their outside forwards play. Di Maria on the left is pushed high and wide, reflecting how his play focused around taking on defenders in wide-attacking areas to create chances, such as winning a penalty for the first goal. On the right is Messi. Throughout Messi's entire career, his positioning has been basically the same with some variations on it: He plays toward the right, and comes more centrally and deeper to get the ball. His positioning for Argentina follows this rule, with his average passing position being nearly as deep as the highest midfielder, and his width being on the border of the central area and right half-space.\

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot.passingNetwork(events.wc.22,final.22.id,tms[2])
```

France's passing network tells a completely different story. As aside from the defense and the outside-backs to the wingers, there is very little connecting. Perhaps most concerningly, the midfield has almost no connections at all. Tchouameni has no connections with his defense, showing him completely unable to connect the defense and attack. Meanwhile, Greizman is on island high up the pitch. The network also shows only one link to the team's centerforward (Giroud), which is a faint link from his goalkeeper. If the lack of passing and connectedness doesn't show that France struggled to generate attacks, the fact that their striker couldn't get the ball should.\
Watching the match backs up these conclusions, with France looking so lost that they made substitutions before halftime, and Argentina completely controlling the game until Di Maria's departure in the 62 minute. What happened after that was a different story, but each network cut off before the game flipped.

### 2018 World Cup Final

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Ball Recoveries
### World Cup 2018
Here are some ball recovery maps from the 2018 world cup. These are 4 of the top 5 outfield players in totals in that category. Which is a great excuse to behold the beauty of an N'Golo Kante Ball Recovery Map.

br.plr.count <- events.br %>% group_by(player.id, player.name, team.name) %>% 
  summarise(total_br=sum(unit)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_br))
print(br.plr.count)

### PPDA
PPDA (Passes Per Defensive Action) is probably the leading statistic in measuring a teams the intensity and effectiveness of a teams high press. Looking only at the attcking 60% of the pitch, PPDA is calculated by dividing the total passes of the opposition by the total number of defensive actions (tackle attempts, interceptions, and fouls committed) perform. Lower the PPDA that teams emphasize pressuring there opposition with urgency high up the pitch. Higher PPDA shows that a team is content sitting back and on letting the opposition come to them.
